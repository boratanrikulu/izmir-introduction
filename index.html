		Once the ancient city of <b><i>Smyrna, Izmir</i></b> is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains. The broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although <b><i>the city has an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.</i></b><br><br>
		
		Izmir owes its position as an economically and socially dynamic city to its location, climate and the fact that it has been a home to many different cultures and religions. <b><i>Persians, Ancient Greeks, Assyrians, Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans</i></b> are just a few of the dozens of different civilizations that the city has hosted throughout its long history.<br><br>

		<b><i>Under Suleyman the Magnificent</i></b>, Smyrna became a thriving and sophisticated city and a huge trading center, despite its frequent earthquakes. It was a cosmopolitan city , with a Greek Orthodox majority along with Armenians, Jews and Muslims. Numerous languages could be heard in the streets, spoken by locals and visiting traders.<b><i> Following World War I </b></i>and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, and on the basis of the majority Greek population in the area, Greece was granted a mandate over Izmir from the Allies. Athens took control over the whole of the Aegean region.<br><br>
		
		Rising tensions led the outbreak of war as <b><i>the Greeks purshed further into the heart of Anatola</i></b> in an attempt to unite the Greek communities of Asia Minor. Led by Kemal Ataturk the Turkish army launched a counter-attack and seized the city. <b><i>Ataturk formally took Izmir on 9 September 1922</i></b>, which is celebrated as the day of the city's liberation.

		<b>Konak Square</b> — Main square of the city center, famous for the clock tower, one of the unique symbols of Izmir. The clock tower was built in 1901. There are also Konak Yali Mosque and Kemeraltı Bazaar located around the square.<br>
		<b>Asansör (Elevator)</b> — It was constructed by a Jewish businessman in 1907. The purpose was to help residents to go to their districts on the top of the hill. The elevator used to work by a water-driven mechanism. Later, it was restored by Izmir Municipality and now it works by electricity. There is a restaurant located on the top of the elevator with a bird-eye view of Izmir.<br>
		<b>Beaches</b> — Having a coastline on Aegean sea, Izmir owns lots of beaches which are not too far from the city center. There is public transportation available to most of them. The places include Foça, Dikili, Urla, Seferihisar, and Çeşme.<br>
